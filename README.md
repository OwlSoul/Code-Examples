## CUDA

### 01. ConvLayer-CUDA
This was a challenge in Taiwan's NCTU for Computer Architecture course.
The task is to compute one layer of Convolutional Neural Network on GPU using CUDA technology. A lot of methods to get noticeable speedups were used, all of them are described in the repository README.

## Python

### 01. GetPlaneFromPCL
This was an entrance micro-challenge for [Yandex Self-Driving Meetup 2019](https://taxi.yandex.ru/action/ysdm). \
The task is to compute the road plane from the point cloud, with the condition that 50% of the points in the cloud should be on or near the plane. RANSAC algorithm was used to solve the problem.
